If you modify the notebook, we cannot guarantee it will run successfully.\n","- This pipeline is optimized for the original data set. The pipeline might fail or produce sub-optimal results if used with different data.  If you want to use a different data set, consider retraining the AutoAI experiment to generate a new pipeline. For more information, see <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/autoai-notebook.html\">Cloud Platform</a>. \n","- Before modifying the pipeline or trying to re-fit the pipeline, consider that the code converts dataframes to numpy arrays before fitting the pipeline (a current restriction of the preprocessor pipeline).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<a id=\"content\"></a>\n","## Notebook content\n","\n","This notebook contains a Scikit-learn representation of AutoAI pipeline.
